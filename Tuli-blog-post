# Building Tuli – A Smart SMB Assistant with Generative AI

**By Louise McCall – WAIPRACTICE 2025 Cohort**

Over the past few weeks, I’ve had the opportunity to take part in the WAIPRACTICE generative AI programme – and what a journey it’s been. My project, developed in collaboration with my brilliant mentor Toma Ijatomi, focused on building a smart assistant for small and medium businesses (SMBs) using low-code tools and generative AI.

## The Problem
Small businesses often struggle to keep up with the demand for consistent, high-quality marketing content. Time, resources, and technical skills are real constraints – especially for sole traders or small teams. That’s where the idea for Tuli came in: a smart assistant that could simplify content creation and make strategic marketing more accessible.

## The Solution
Tuli is a generative AI-powered marketing assistant built using N8n, a powerful low-code automation platform. It integrates tools like OpenAI for copy generation, Runway and Eleven Labs for video and voice, and Google AI Studio for advanced personalisation.

The system works like this: a user completes a form selecting their content needs and target platforms. From there, Tuli runs workflows specific to each platform (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, blog posts, even video) and generates customised marketing assets. These include images, copy, and audio/video content.

One of Tuli’s standout features is its **audience adaptability**. Users can input details about their target audience (demographics, tone, industry, product links), and Tuli creates tailored content accordingly. Users can also upload a product photo and have Tuli generate video content to match.

## Learning Through Building
Coming from a non-technical background, I relied heavily on N8n’s low-code environment and Toma’s patient mentorship. I learned how to:
- Build modular workflows using nodes and triggers
- Integrate APIs and use HTTP requests
- Debug errors using tools like ChatGPT
- Improve generative output through prompt iteration

The learning curve was steep, but the result was worth it. We built a working model that I can continue to improve and expand.

## Analytics and Feedback Loop
Tuli doesn’t stop at creation. It also tracks social media performance, providing weekly insights that help users refine their content strategy. Most importantly, we’ve built in a human-in-the-loop system: users can review and edit content, then provide feedback to improve Tuli’s responses over time.

## Reflections
This project pushed me outside my comfort zone and deepened my understanding of what’s possible with AI. Having a supportive mentor made all the difference. Toma was not only knowledgeable but also kind, generous with her time, and incredibly encouraging.

## What’s Next
Tuli is still in its early days, but it’s a strong foundation for a tool I hope will genuinely empower SMBs. I’d love to continue building, test it with real users, and eventually offer it as a product to small businesses who need practical, affordable marketing help.
